Our team at CITIESair is working hard to bring the existing data visualizations on <a href='https://citiesdashboard.com/project/air-quality'>NYUAD's Air Quality Dashboard</a> to your dashboard here. We expect the transition to be completed by the end of <b>October 2023</b>.<br/><br/>In the meantime, you can browse the descriptions of air quality categories and recent historical air quality data at your school below. All past historical data will be added soon. You can also click on the <b>TV Screen</b> button below to visualize on a big public TV screen real-time air quality comparison between the indoor and outdoor sensors.",

To calculate the AQI from the raw measurement of PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³), different breakpoints and piecewise linear function are utilized (read more <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#United_States'>here</a>). Higher AQI values correspond to poorer air quality and greater heath risks to humans.<br><br>The US EPA sets thresholds for PM2.5 concentration: <sup>[1]</sup><ul><li><b>Annual average</b>: 12.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>50</b></li><li><b>24-hour average</b>: 35.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>100</b></li></ul>In 2021, the World's Heath Organization (WHO) proposed a new guideline for PM2.5<sup>[2]</sup> with stricter thresholds than those of the US EPA:<ul><li><b>Annual average</b>: 5.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>21</b></li><li><b>24-hour average</b>: 15.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>56</b></li></ul>",
