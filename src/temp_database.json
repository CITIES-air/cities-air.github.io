Thanks to air filtration systems, indoor PM2.5 concentrations are significantly lower than its outdoor counterpart, around <b>6x</b> and <b>4x</b> lower for Campus Center (C2) and East Dining Hall (D2), respectively. Due to cooking activities, air quality in D2 is estimated to be <b>1.5x</b> worse than the Campus Center when comparing their daily average.",
