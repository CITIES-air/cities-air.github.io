  subtitle: "CITIESair uses the <a href='https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/'>Air Quality Index (AQI)</a> developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to effectively communicate different levels of PM2.5 air pollution. To calculate the AQI from the raw measurement of PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³), different breakpoints and piecewise linear function are utilized (read more <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#United_States'>here</a>). Higher AQI values correspond to poorer air quality and greater heath risks to humans.<br><br>The US EPA sets thresholds for PM2.5 concentration: <sup>[1]</sup><ul><li><b>Annual average</b>: 12.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>50</b></li><li><b>24-hour average</b>: 35.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>100</b></li></ul>In 2021, the World's Heath Organization (WHO) proposed a new guideline for PM2.5<sup>[2]</sup> with stricter thresholds than those of the US EPA:<ul><li><b>Annual average</b>: 5.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>21</b></li><li><b>24-hour average</b>: 15.0 µg/m³, corresponding to US AQI <b>56</b></li></ul>",
