# Expandable Section
#### 1. `ExpandableSection`

**Purpose:** This component allows for the creation of sections in the UI that can be expanded or collapsed by the user. It is ideal for FAQs, detailed content sections, and any place where conserving space while making detailed information accessible is desired.

**Implementation:**
- The component utilizes state to track whether the section is currently expanded or collapsed.
- It renders a header (or trigger) that the user can interact with to toggle the expansion state. This might be implemented as a button or a similar clickable element.
- The body of the section contains the content that is shown or hidden based on the component's state.
- Styling and animations may be applied to smooth the transition between states and enhance user experience.

#### 2. `useExpandable`

**Purpose:** This custom hook provides the logic for managing the expanded/collapsed state of the section. It encapsulates the functionality to toggle the state, allowing for reuse across different components or instances.

**Implementation:**
- The hook returns the current state (expanded or collapsed) and a function to toggle this state.
- It can be integrated into `ExpandableSection` or any other component that requires expandable functionality.

#### 3. `ExpandableContext`

**Purpose:** In cases where multiple `ExpandableSection` components need to be coordinated (e.g., ensuring only one section is expanded at a time), `ExpandableContext` provides a context-based solution.

**Implementation:**
- This React context manages the state of multiple expandable sections collectively.
- Components within the same context can communicate, allowing for behaviors such as collapsing all other sections when a new one is expanded.

#### 4. `StyledExpandableSection`

**Purpose:** This styled component variant of `ExpandableSection` includes default styling that can be overridden or extended. It ensures consistency in the appearance of expandable sections throughout the application.

**Implementation:**
- Utilizes `styled-components` or similar CSS-in-JS libraries to apply styles.
- Styles may include transitions for the expand/collapse animation, as well as visual cues to indicate the section's state (e.g., an arrow icon that rotates).
